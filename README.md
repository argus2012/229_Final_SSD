## Autonomous Driving System

With the increasing penetration of ADAS in new cars, such as, ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control), LDW (Lane Departure Warning), and AVP (Automated Valet Parking), these kinds of ADAS functions are being more and more popular. Meanwhile, self-driving cars are being tested on public roads by some giant technology and carmaker companies, such as Waymo, Baidu and GM. Self-driving Robotaxis are taking off in many cities in China and US.
